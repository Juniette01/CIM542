The digital hourglass project uses 6 LEDs which are connected to ground with six 220-ohms resistors. It also has a tilt switch connected to ground via a 10-kilohm resistor. This hourglass works by turning on an LED every 10 minutes. Since it has 6 LEDs, it will take an hour for all of them to turn on. You reset the hourglass by flipping it over. The tilt switch sensing this movement causes it to start over from 0 LEDs on. Video:
