Idea 1: Create a group of birds (3 - 4?) that interact with each other. Depending on which bird is touched first, they make a different sequence of sounds.

Idea 2: Similar to the bird idea, but with endangered animals. You have to touch each one (3 - 4 animals) to get a reaction. They also interact with each other.

Idea 3: Using birds as a musical instrument
