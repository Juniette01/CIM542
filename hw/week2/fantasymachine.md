The machine I would build would be a laundry bot. You throw your dirty clothes into hampers that are connected to the machine. These hampers are separated into colors, whites, and darks. When you are ready to do your laundry, you input your desired settings on the machine's screen. Settings include what kind of wash you need (cold, warm, delicate, normal, perm press, etc.) for each hamper and whether you want the machine to automatically dry your clothes or wait to be prompted. If you choose to prompt the machine you will be to remove the clothes that need to be air-dried before continuing with the dryer. There are also settings for drying time and how hot you want the dryer to run.

Once you are done with your selections, the machine will be able to dump the contents of the first hamper into the laundry drum, as well as put the right amount of detergent, bleach, or fabric softener depending on the load size. It will clean the clothes on your chosen settings and then move on to drying them. While the dryer is running, the machine will start washing the next hamper.

Once the dryer is done with each hamper, the machine will automatically be able to fold your clothes.

The machine will warn you when it is low on detergent, bleach, or fabric softener and also when any of those are empty. It will also alert you to clean the lint filter.
